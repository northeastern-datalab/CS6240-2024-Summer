		<h5>Recommended Textbook and Materials</h5>
		<p>
            There is no required textbook because the 
            instructor provides textbook-like course material. To gain a deeper understanding of the 
            material covered in this course, we recommend the following books (most should be 
            available online for free for Northeastern University students from Oâ€™Reilly for Higher 
            Education):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Design Patterns by Donald Miner and Adam Shook</li>
            <li>Hadoop: The Definitive Guide by Tom White</li>
            <li>High Performance Spark by Holden Karau and Rachel Warren</li>
            <li>Spark: The Definitive Guide by Bill Chambers and Matei Zaharia</li>
            <li>Spark in Action by Petar Zecevic and Marko Bonaci</li>
            <li>Programming Elastic MapReduce by Kevin Schmidt and Christopher Phillips</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For some topics we will work with research papers or other online resources, e.g., the 
            Hadoop and Spark API doc.
